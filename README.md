# QTerminal
Terminal (PyQt5)

This is a fork of [PyQtTerminal](https://github.com/CountryTk/PyQtTerminal/blob/master/Untitled_file_61.py) that does not work.
I have removed a lot of code and changed a lot.

### Requirements:

- python3
- PyQt5

### Notes:

- you can drag files or text to the window
- commands list and geometry will be saved

QTerminal2 is a different version and can handle QProcess with pipe

for example:

> cat file > /folder/newfile.text
